# #uniteddevs
A movement to stop racism

The last days made it clear – we need to stand up to stop this pain people face cause of skin color, gender, religion,… 

This manifesto and the #uniteddev movement provide behavioral instructions we as developers give ourselves to stop racism and to stand up for the people who are sadly facing these problems. New goals don’t deliver new results. We need to change our habits to create a different outcome. 

We are convinced that a united world of developers can make a difference and lead our world to a place where everyone can live without being afraid because of skin color, gender or religion.

We want to change our habits to truly make a change. Let us start today.

The no racism Manifesto of developers

In our daily life we almost forgot that people are facing problems based on racism. We maybe watched away at some point. We could have fought harder to save lives. And it is sad that the man George Floyd had to die to make us move. We have to change ourselves. That is what we owe George, his family and every other human living in fear cause of racism.

1.	We make ourselves and the people around us aware of racism and that there are problems based on racism every day.
2.	We will educate ourselves and our children to learn about diversity.
3.	We will build up knowledge about this topic by reading books to rethink our view on the world and to be educated better.
4.	When we face a specific situation in our lives where racism is a part of, we help the victim directly.
5.	We always ask our behavior for example in interview situation to make sure decisions are made on skin color, religion, gender …
6.	We stop supporting organizations and institutions promoting hate.

Why this is important

History brought us to the present. There is nothing to do about the past. But it would be our mistake and our fault to not do something in the present to create a better future without racism!
